# Logistic Map

Exploring the logistic map!

```
x[n+1] = r * x[n] * (1-x[n])
```

Controls:

- To set a new interval, press `f` while the mouse is on the left boundary and
and then `t` while the mouse is on the right boundary. This will recalculate
the values to display a new value.
- To restart the map, press `r`. This is the same of displaying the map in
the interval `[0,4]`.
